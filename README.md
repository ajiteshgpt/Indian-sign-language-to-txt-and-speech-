# ðŸ¤Ÿ Sign Language Recognition to Speech

A real-time sign language recognition system that converts hand gestures into text and speech. This project uses artificial intelligence to help bridge the communication gap between sign language users and those who don't understand sign language.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Does This Project Do?

Imagine having a translator that can watch your hand movements and instantly convert them into spoken words! That's exactly what this project does. It:

- **Watches your hands** through your computer's camera
- **Recognizes sign language letters** (currently supports letters A, C, and T)
- **Converts gestures to text** and displays them on screen
- **Speaks the text aloud** using computer-generated voice
- **Works in real-time** - no delays or waiting!

## ðŸŒŸ Why Is This Important?

Sign language is used by millions of people worldwide, but not everyone understands it. This technology can:
- Help deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals communicate with others
- Assist in learning sign language
- Provide accessibility tools for education and workplaces
- Bridge communication barriers in public spaces

## ðŸš€ How It Works (Simple Explanation)

Think of this system like teaching a computer to "see" and "understand" hand gestures:

1. **ðŸ‘ï¸ Seeing**: Your camera captures video of your hands
2. **ðŸ” Understanding**: The computer identifies key points on your hands (like fingertips and joints)
3. **ðŸ§  Learning**: An AI model (trained on many examples) recognizes what letter you're signing
4. **ðŸ’¬ Speaking**: The system converts the recognized letters into text and speech

## ðŸ› ï¸ What Each File Does

### 1ï¸âƒ£ Data Collection (`1.data.collection.py`)
**What it does**: Takes photos of your hand gestures to teach the computer
- Opens your camera
- Lets you take 100 photos for each sign language letter
- Saves photos in organized folders
- **When to use**: When you want to train the system on new gestures

### 2ï¸âƒ£ Hand Landmarks (`2.HandLandmarks.py`)
**What it does**: Analyzes the photos to find important hand features
- Looks at each photo and finds 21 key points on your hand
- Measures the positions of fingertips, knuckles, and palm
- Saves this information as numbers the computer can understand
- **When to use**: After collecting photos, before training

### 3ï¸âƒ£ Train Model (`3.TrainModel.py`)
**What it does**: Teaches the computer to recognize different gestures
- Uses the hand measurements to learn patterns
- Tests two different AI approaches (Random Forest and SVM)
- Saves the best-performing model for later use
- **When to use**: After processing photos, before running the app

### 4ï¸âƒ£ Main Application (`4.Deployment.py`)
**What it does**: The actual sign language translator you'll use
- Shows live camera feed with hand tracking
- Recognizes your gestures in real-time
- Displays recognized letters as text
- Converts text to speech
- **When to use**: This is your main application!

### 5ï¸âƒ£ Enhanced Version (`4.1Deployment-2-frame.py`)
**What it does**: Improved version with better accuracy
- Same features as the main app
- Enhanced detection for better performance
- Can handle multiple hands
- **When to use**: If you want the most accurate version

## ðŸ”§ Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Install Python
- Download Python from [python.org](https://python.org)
- Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Open your command prompt/terminal and type:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe scikit-learn numpy matplotlib tkinter gtts pickle
```

### Step 3: Download the Project
- Download all the Python files to a folder on your computer
- Make sure they're all in the same folder

## ðŸŽ® How to Use

### For First-Time Users (Complete Setup):

1. **Collect Training Data**
   ```bash
   python 1.data.collection.py
   ```
   - Press 'Q' when ready to take photos for each letter
   - Make clear gestures for letters A, C, and T
   - The system will automatically take 100 photos for each

2. **Process the Photos**
   ```bash
   python 2.HandLandmarks.py
   ```
   - This analyzes your photos (takes a few minutes)
   - Creates a file called `data.pickle`

3. **Train the AI Model**
   ```bash
   python 3.TrainModel.py
   ```
   - Trains the computer to recognize your gestures
   - Creates a file called `model.p`
   - Shows accuracy percentage when done

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python 4.Deployment.py
   ```
   - Your camera will open
   - Start making sign language gestures!
   - Letters will appear in the text box
   - Use buttons to speak or clear text

### For Regular Use:
Just run: `python 4.Deployment.py`

## ðŸŽ¯ Supported Gestures

Currently, the system recognizes:
- **Letter A**: Closed fist with thumb on the side
- **Letter C**: Curved hand shape like holding a cup
- **Letter T**: Fist with thumb tucked between fingers

## ðŸ“± User Interface Features

The application window includes:
- **Live camera view** with hand tracking overlay
- **Text display area** showing recognized letters
- **Clear Text button** (orange) - removes all text
- **Speak Text button** (green) - reads text aloud in English
- **Translate Speech button** (purple) - reads text in French
- **Exit button** (red) - closes the application

## ðŸ” Technical Details (For Curious Users)

### How Hand Recognition Works:
1. **MediaPipe**: Google's AI tool finds 21 points on your hand
2. **Coordinate Processing**: Converts hand positions to numbers
3. **Machine Learning**: AI model learns patterns from training data
4. **Classification**: Matches new gestures to learned patterns

### AI Models Used:
- **Random Forest**: Uses multiple decision trees for classification
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Finds optimal boundaries between different gestures
- The system automatically chooses the most accurate model

### Performance Features:
- **Real-time processing**: Less than 100ms detection time
- **Stability checks**: Requires consistent gesture for 1 second before recognition
- **Multi-hand support**: Can detect gestures from either hand
- **Confidence filtering**: Only recognizes gestures above 70% confidence

## ðŸ› ï¸ Customization Options

### Adding New Gestures:
1. Modify `number_of_classes` in `1.data.collection.py`
2. Update `labels_dict` in deployment files with new letters/words
3. Follow the same training process

### Adjusting Sensitivity:
- Change `min_detection_confidence` in deployment files
- Modify timing requirements in the gesture detection logic

### Language Support:
- Modify the `speak_text()` function language parameter
- Supported languages include: 'en' (English), 'es' (Spanish), 'fr' (French), 'de' (German), etc.

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Camera not working?**
- Check if other apps are using your camera
- Try changing `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` to `cv2.VideoCapture(1)`

**Low accuracy?**
- Ensure good lighting when collecting training data
- Make consistent, clear gestures
- Collect more training data (increase `dataset_size`)

**Application won't start?**
- Make sure all files are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that Python is properly installed
- Ensure all project files are in the same folder

**No sound output?**
- Check your computer's audio settings
- Ensure internet connection (required for text-to-speech)
